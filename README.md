"Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)"

Introduction: 
A website with recipes. Each recipe will have an unordered ingredient list and detailed step-by-step instructions.

Skills:
Basic website that links to other pages. Inserting images, ordered and unordered lists. Making consistent commits and writing good commit messsages.
